# Artificial React

A lightweight **vanilla JavaScript** project that simulates coding in **React** â€” designed for creating **React-like components** and **dynamic UIs** without any build tools or installations.

This project was made so that I can **code React-style on mobile devices** (using only a browser or a mobile code editor) and later **transfer the same code to a real React project on PC** with minimal changes.

By using functions that return a single `<div>` element and template literals for markup, this setup mimics Reactâ€™s component structure, JSX-like syntax, and dynamic rendering (using `.map()`), making the transition to React almost seamless.

---

## âœ¨ Purpose

- **Code React-style UI anywhere** â€” even on mobile without Node.js or npm.
- **Keep your code structure similar to React**, so you can move it to a React/Vite project later with minimal edits.
- **Experiment and learn React concepts** (components, props, data mapping) using only vanilla JavaScript.

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- Uses functions as React-like components.
- Supports dynamic rendering using JavaScript arrays and `.map()`.
- Outputs UI using template literals (simulating JSX).
- Zero setup â€” just open `index.html` in any browser.

## ðŸš€ To Run This Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khianvictorycalderon/Artificial-React.git
2. Open `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start editing `assets/script.js`, your code will render dynamically.
